This task 0 is to create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.


Task 1: Copy the main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.
